## History

At first, `tidyr` had functions called `spread` and `gather`

- The names were confusing, 

- the argument names were hard to remember, 

- the functions supported a limited set of transformations from wide to long, and vice versa.

In a later update, `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` were introduced as more intuitive and powerful versions of `spread` and `gather`.

I have found `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` to be easier to use than `spread` and `gather`, so I am only teaching the `pivot` functions. However, you are welcome to use `spread` and `gather` in your assignments.

---

## pivot to longer data

We'll start with the long covid-19 data:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
cv19
```

---

## pivot to longer data

Then pivot to a longer form with

- cases and death values in the `value` column

- cases and death indicators in the `name` column.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
cv19_long <- cv19 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(cases, deaths)) #<<
  
cv19_long[1:5, ]

```

---

## How is this helpful?

Longer data are ideal for `ggplot`

```{r}
ggplot(cv19_long, aes(x=date, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = state)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = 'free')
```

---

## Pivot to wider data

We'll start with the `nhanes_long` data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
nhanes_long <- select(nhanes, exam, sex, race_ethnicity, bp_sys_mmhg)
#nhanes_long <- select(nhanes, exam, sex, race_ethnicity, starts_with('bp'))
```

```{r}
nhanes_long
```

---

## Pivot to wider data

Then give the systolic BP values a column for each exam

```{r}
nhanes_wide <- nhanes_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(values_from = bp_sys_mmhg, #<<
    names_from = exam, names_prefix = 'exam_') #<<

nhanes_wide
```

---

## How is this helpful?

Wider data are ideal for `gt`. 

```{r}

year_cols <- paste("exam", c('2013', '2015','2017'), sep = '_')
# looks like these data are not wide enough!
gt(nhanes_wide) %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = year_cols, decimals = 1) %>% 
  cols_align(columns = 'race_ethnicity', align = 'left')
```


---

## More wider

What if we need to draw names from two columns?

```{r}

nhanes_wider <- nhanes_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(sex, exam), values_from = bp_sys_mmhg)

nhanes_wider

```

---

## More wider

I need to re-order the columns for `gt`

```{r}
nhanes_wider <- nhanes_wider %>% 
  select(
    race_ethnicity, 
    starts_with("Female"), 
    starts_with("Male")
  )

nhanes_wider 
```


---

## More wider

Often you need to access groups of columns in `gt` tables. 

- I recommend doing this with a character vector:

```{r}

cols <- expand.grid(c('Female', 'Male'), c('2013', '2015', '2017')) %>% 
  glue::glue_data("{Var1}_{Var2}") %>% 
  as.character()

cols[1:3]
cols[4:6]
```

---

## Wider data, cleaner table?

Oh no, is this too wide??

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gt(nhanes_wider, rowname_col = 'race_ethnicity') #<<
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gt(nhanes_wider, rowname_col = 'race_ethnicity')
```

---

## Wider data, cleaner table?

- reducing the length numbers helps, but 

- also need to reduce the redundant column names

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gt(nhanes_wider, rowname_col = 'race_ethnicity') %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = cols, decimals = 1) %>% #<<
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gt(nhanes_wider, rowname_col = 'race_ethnicity') %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = cols, decimals = 1) 
```

---

## Wider data, cleaner table!

Convert column names into spanner labels!

(this is why I needed to re-order my column names)

```{r}
gt(nhanes_wider, rowname_col = 'race_ethnicity') %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = cols, decimals = 1) %>% 
  tab_spanner_delim(columns = cols, delim = '_') #<<
```


---

## Aside

Always remember to label the stub:

```{r}
gt(nhanes_wider, rowname_col = 'race_ethnicity') %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = cols, decimals = 1) %>% 
  tab_spanner_delim(columns = cols, delim = '_') %>% 
  tab_stubhead("Race") #<<
```


---

## Pivot longer with 2+ names

Columns are named `[sex value]_[exam value]`

- so tell `pivot_longer` that `names_sep = "_"`

```{r}
pivot_longer(nhanes_wider, cols = -race_ethnicity, 
    names_to = c('sex', 'exam'), names_sep = '_')
```
